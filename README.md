Custom launcher and game patcher for **Taz: Wanted**.

**This patcher is the only one authorized for speedrun PC version of Taz: Wanted on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/taz_wanted)!**

The source code and images were taken from **[Taz: Wanted Trainer and Patcher](https://github.com/MuxaJlbl4/Taz_Wanted_trainer_and_patcher)** project created by **[MuxaJlbl4 (MuLLlaH9!)](https://github.com/MuxaJlbl4)** with his permission.

This patcher supports restoring game files after using Taz: Wanted Trainer and Patcher, provided that Taz.exe.backup in the root of the game folder is the original executable file dated 8/12/2002 for the US version of the game.

Also this patcher doesn't conflict with Taz: Wanted Trainer and Patcher, as it creates its own SpeedrunningPatcher.xml save file (instead of Patcher.xml).
